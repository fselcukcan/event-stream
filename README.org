* event stream implementaiton from scratch with a functional programming approach.
* no dependencies exist. EventTarget standard class is not used.
* events dispatched do not have to be standard JavaScript Event or CustomEvent objects.
* any object can be used instead provided having a type property.
* standard JavaScript event function naming is kept for convenience but prone to change till stable.
